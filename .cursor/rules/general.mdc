- A Carmageddon: Max Damage clone using:
    - Bundler: Vite 
    - Rendering: Three.js
    - Physics: Cannon.js 
    - Audio: Howler.js
- Always go with the simplest implemenation version that works. No fallbacks if librarys don't work, just throw errors but never implement fallbacks.
- Find the steps in [project-steps.md](mdc:project-steps.md)
- Work on whatever steps I tell yopu to work on and only work on those steps.
- Then stop, I will give you further instruction.
